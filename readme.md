## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="24px"> About

Ecoleta is a marketplace that helps people find waste collection points efficiently. 

It was developed during Next Level Week at <b><a href="https://github.com/Rocketseat">@rocketseat</a></b>, a week of total immersion in programming using the stack: NodeJS, React and React Native!

You can learn more about Next Level Week <b><a href="https://nextlevelweek.com/">here!</a></b>

The entire layout of this project was developed by the UI Designer of Rocketseat <b><a href="https://instagram.com/tiagoluchtenberg">@tiagoluchtenberg</a></b>, but the dark mode was adapted by me, since it was not in the original design.
