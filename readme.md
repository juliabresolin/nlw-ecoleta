## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; What is Ecoleta?

Ecoleta is an open-source project of a marketplace that helps people find waste collection points efficiently. 

It was developed during Next Level Week at <b><a href="https://github.com/Rocketseat">@rocketseat</a></b>, a week of total immersion in programming using the stack: NodeJS, React and React Native!

You can learn more about Next Level Week <b><a href="https://nextlevelweek.com/">here!</a></b>
<br><br>

## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; What technologies are used?

For the development of Ecoleta, the stack was used as a basis: `node.js`, `reactjs` and `react native`.

Along with the stack, technologies such as restfull api, styled components, dark mode, hooks, api to search for adresses in real time (IBGE), among others, were used.

You can view the layout of the project through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/mYXr7gWbTx9Tojo6G46Qfy/Ecoleta-Booster?node-id=0%3A1), as long as you have a [Figma](https://figma.com)account!

The entire layout of this project was developed by the UI Designer of Rocketseat [@tiagoluchtenberg](https://instagram.com/tiagoluchtenberg), but the dark mode was adapted by me, since it was not in the original design.
